<supporting_reading>
Start from the narrow structural-health packet:
- `.planning/PROJECT.md`, `.planning/ROADMAP.md`, `.planning/STATE.md`, and `.planning/config.json` when present
- command arguments and any immediately previous health output when this is a rerun
</supporting_reading>

<deeper_reading>
Only widen into broader runtime, governing-doc, or audit carriers when structural health is already understood and the next route actually becomes repo-local posture uplift. Keep the widening order compact first, narrative second, typed last. Do not blend structural repair, runtime update, and doctrine refresh into one unbounded pass.

<step name="parse_args">
**Parse arguments:**

Check if `--repair` flag is present in the command arguments.

```
REPAIR_FLAG=""
if arguments contain "--repair"; then
  REPAIR_FLAG="--repair"
fi
```
</step>

<step name="run_health_check">
**Run health validation:**

```bash
gsd-sdk query validate.health $REPAIR_FLAG
```

Parse JSON output:
- `status`: "healthy" | "degraded" | "broken"
- `errors[]`: Critical issues (code, message, fix, repairable)
- `warnings[]`: Non-critical issues
- `info[]`: Informational notes
- `repairable_count`: Number of auto-fixable issues
- `repairs_performed[]`: Actions taken if --repair was used
</step>

<step name="keep_route_boundaries_explicit">
**Keep structural repair distinct from broader repo-local posture refresh:**

- The authoritative three-way split is stated in `review_project_uplift_health_follow_through` -> `Interpretation Frame`.
- `health` owns structural planning integrity and limited low-risk repair.
- If core planning state is missing entirely, route to `$gsd-new-project` or `$gsd-ingest-docs` as appropriate rather than treating the problem as project uplift.
- If planning structure is present but the project still carries older or thinner repo-local runtime, governing-doc, or doctrine posture, route separately to `$gsd-uplift-project --write` after health instead of mutating that posture inside repair.
</step>

<step name="offer_repair">
**If repairable issues exist and --repair was NOT used:**

Ask user if they want to run repairs:

```
Would you like to run $gsd-health --repair to fix N issues automatically?
```

If yes, re-run with --repair flag and display results.
</step>

<step name="verify_repairs">
**If repairs were performed:**

Re-run health check without --repair to confirm issues are resolved:

```bash
gsd-sdk query validate.health
```

Report final status.
</step>

<step name="review_project_uplift_health_follow_through">
**Review Project Uplift Health Follow-Through:**

Only surface this step after all structural health validation is complete, including `verify_repairs` when `--repair` was used.

This step is read-only and route-local. Do not run `$gsd-uplift-project --write` from inside it.

Only widen into `.planning/UPLIFT-REPORT.md` or `.planning/UPLIFT-MANIFEST.json` from inside this dedicated step, and only after the compact `STATE.md` `## Project Uplift` reread has shown that route-local posture pressure is still live.

Only surface the step when:
- structural planning state is present
- the route is no longer broken or missing-planning
- the compact `STATE.md` `## Project Uplift` block still shows live posture pressure rather than ordinary steady-state continuation

Treat the following as live posture pressure signals:
- `Compatibility posture` is not exactly `observed_basis_only`
- `Held runtime annotation` is present and not `none`
- `Current recommendation` is not exactly `Continue with ordinary routing.`
- `Observed runtime basis` becomes route-local only when the current health pass follows runtime movement, migration, or another state change that makes the compact basis line newly consequential after validation

## Primary Compact Read

Start with `.planning/STATE.md` and reread `## Project Uplift` first.

Keep this compact digest primary over deeper widening. Use it to read:
- `Last uplift pass`
- `Last uplift class`
- `Compatibility posture: observed_basis_only`
- `Observed runtime basis`
- `Held runtime annotation`
- `Current recommendation`

If the compact digest already resolves the route-local posture question, stop here.

## Supporting Narrative Read

Only widen into `.planning/UPLIFT-REPORT.md` when the compact digest does not carry enough route-local context.

Use the report to understand:
- `Before-State Posture`
- `Recommendation Reasons`
- `Compatibility Basis`
- `Held Runtime Annotation`
- `Wider Compatibility Claims Held`
- `Carrier Posture`

## Deeper Typed Read

Only widen into `.planning/UPLIFT-MANIFEST.json` when basis or annotation ambiguity remains after the compact and narrative reads.

Use the typed manifest to resolve:
- `compatibility_basis`
- `held_runtime_annotation`
- `held_later_families`
- per-carrier fingerprints and typed posture fields

Do not mirror manifest content into a new health-local cache or output surface.

## Interpretation Frame

Keep the ownership split explicit:
- `gsd-sdk query validate.health` remains the structural-health authority
- this step owns only read-only uplift-continuity surfacing after validation
- `$gsd-uplift-project --write` remains the later write-side posture-refresh authority
- The footer remains the write-side route pointer when later posture refresh is still live.
- This step remains the read-only continuity reread.
- Both may surface in one pass without duplicating ownership or turning health into a second uplift workflow.

Do not compute compatibility drift here.
Do not widen the health footer into a second uplift workflow.
Do not relabel held runtime annotation into a top-level compatibility posture row.

## When To Surface

Place this step:
- after all structural health validation, including `verify_repairs` when `--repair` was used
- before `format_output`

Keep it silent when:
- planning structure is missing and the correct route is `$gsd-new-project` or `$gsd-ingest-docs`
- structural health itself is still the unresolved question
- the compact `Project Uplift` block resolves to ordinary routing without later posture pressure, including:
  - `Compatibility posture: observed_basis_only`
  - `Held runtime annotation: none`
  - `Current recommendation: Continue with ordinary routing.`

━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Status: HEALTHY | DEGRADED | BROKEN
Errors: N | Warnings: N | Info: N

**If repairs were performed:**
```
## Repairs Performed

- ✓ config.json: Created with defaults
- ✓ STATE.md: Regenerated from roadmap
```

**If errors exist:**
```
## Errors

- [E001] config.json: JSON parse error at line 5
  Fix: Run $gsd-health --repair to reset to defaults

- [E002] PROJECT.md not found
  Fix: Run $gsd-new-project to create
```

**If warnings exist:**
```
## Warnings

- [W002] STATE.md references phase 5, but only phases 1-3 exist
  Fix: Review STATE.md manually before changing it; repair will not overwrite an existing STATE.md

- [W005] Phase directory "1-setup" doesn't follow NN-name format
  Fix: Rename to match pattern (e.g., 01-setup)
```

**If info exists:**
```
## Info

- [I001] 02-implementation/02-01-PLAN.md has no SUMMARY.md
  Note: May be in progress
```

**Footer (if repairable issues exist and --repair was NOT used):**
```

N issues can be auto-repaired. Run: $gsd-health --repair
```

**Footer (if structural health is acceptable but repo-local posture still needs refresh):**
```
---
Structural health is not the same thing as repo-local posture refresh.
If runtime/governing-doc/doctrine posture is the live issue, run: $gsd-uplift-project --write

- Phase directory renaming
- Orphaned plan cleanup

<stale_task_cleanup>
**Windows-specific:** Check for stale Claude Code task directories that accumulate on crash/freeze.
These are left behind when subagents are force-killed and consume disk space.

When `--repair` is active, detect and clean up:

```bash
# Check for stale task directories (older than 24 hours)
TASKS_DIR="/home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/.codex/tasks"
if [ -d "$TASKS_DIR" ]; then
  STALE_COUNT=$( (find "$TASKS_DIR" -maxdepth 1 -type d -mtime +1 2>/dev/null || true) | wc -l )
  if [ "$STALE_COUNT" -gt 0 ]; then
    echo "⚠️  Found $STALE_COUNT stale task directories in /home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/.codex/tasks/"
    echo "   These are leftover from crashed subagent sessions."
    echo "   Run: rm -rf /home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/.codex/tasks/*  (safe — only affects dead sessions)"
  fi
fi
```

Report as info diagnostic: `I002 | info | Stale subagent task directories found | Yes (--repair removes them)`
