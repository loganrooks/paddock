# Runtime Visibility Tranche Packet

## Purpose

- [g:r:i] This packet scopes a narrow cross-vendor review of the runtime-visibility tranche that just landed.
- [d:r:i] The target is not the whole readiness-rerun workspace. The target is the recent second-tranche sequence:
  - drift-register pilot
  - manifest semantic contract
  - final-runtime visibility proposal
  - first-pass runtime-visibility implementation
  - associated instruction/doc carry

## Review Questions

- [d:r:i] Did this tranche actually improve intervention carry, or merely re-label an already-known surface?
- [d:r:i] What gaps, weak spots, or misclassifications still remain in the runtime-visibility tool or its surrounding doctrine?
- [d:r:i] What is the strongest next improvement move from here?
- [d:r:i] Should the repo’s `AGENTS.md` doctrine be translated into `CLAUDE.md`-style equivalents for cross-vendor Claude lanes, and if so, what should and should not be mirrored?

## Explicit Non-Goals

- [d:r:i] Do not re-audit the full readiness-rerun program.
- [d:r:i] Do not rewrite docs or code directly.
- [d:r:i] Do not use threshold framing (`adequate`, `good enough`, `passes`, `ready`) as the governing question.
