# Propagation Chain Reread Packet

## Purpose

- [g:r:i] This packet presents the current propagation-audit family after one concrete follow-through implementation.
- [g:r:i] The target is not only local coherence inside one helper. The target is the surrounding contract-carry chain:
  - producer logic
  - direct consumers
  - durable outputs
  - installer/materialization bridge
  - governing and discovery carriers that should make dependency relations visible
- [g:r:i] The question is how strongly the current chain now carries change propagation, where surrounding carriers still thin or stay ambient, and what should be strengthened next without collapsing back into generic “did we maybe update enough?” talk.

## What This Packet Should Let The Reread Judge

- [d:r:i] What the current producer / consumer / durable-output / materialization chain already carries strongly.
- [d:r:i] Which neighboring carriers now stay explicit and which still remain ambient, under-routed, or under-disclosed.
- [d:r:i] Whether the docs/tooling layer now gives enough visibility into dependency relations for later changes to propagate cleanly.
- [d:r:i] Which surrounding workflow, skill, script, output, or governance surfaces still deserve stronger placement in the propagation family.
- [d:r:i] Which next moves would intensify propagation architecture from the now-landed two-consumer baseline.
