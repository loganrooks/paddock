# Review-Route Parallelization-Adjacent Propagation Audit Opening Note

## Role

- [d:r:i] This opening note is the paired propagation object for the development-side protocol tranche in [../intervention-proposals/169-harness-modifier-development-parallelization-and-intervention-lifecycle-protocol-consolidation-proposal.md](../intervention-proposals/169-harness-modifier-development-parallelization-and-intervention-lifecycle-protocol-consolidation-proposal.md).
- [d:r:i] Its job is to inspect whether the already-landed review-route helper-backed run-home slice carried all the parallelization-adjacent consequences it should have carried, or whether some protocol/measurement/provenance surfaces are still ownerless.

## Why This Audit Is Active Now

- [d:r:i] The parallelization internal cross-audit explicitly called for one targeted propagation audit on already-landed parallelization-adjacent workflow changes before broader workflow rewrites reopen.
- [d:r:i] The cleanest candidate is the review-route helper-backed run-home slice because it already moved:
  - durable run-home ownership
  - launch-truth carry
  - timing calibration
  - last-message salvage
  - reviewer-state classification
- [d:r:i] That means it already touches the same families the protocol tranche will govern more explicitly.

## Audit Questions

### 1. Did `145 + 53` Fully Carry The Development-Side Consequence?

- [d:r:i] Check whether the landed review-route slice propagated strongly enough into:
  - workflow doctrine
  - continuation/compaction guidance
  - launch-truth / timing expectations
  - safe overlap / must-wait / recheck logic
  - review-route family docs

### 2. Which Surfaces Are Still Ownerless Or Under-Carried?

- [d:r:i] Do not only reread the helper and workflow patch itself.
- [d:r:i] Ask whether adjacent doctrine or operator surfaces should already have moved but did not.
- [d:r:i] Probe these candidate under-carried surfaces explicitly rather than treating the audit as an open survey:

### 3. What Should Stay Explicitly Later?

- [d:r:i] Keep broader review-route redesign, subject splits, retry/resume widening, and harness-in-action parallelization out of this audit.

## Out Of Scope

- [d:r:i] new review-route implementation in this note
- [d:r:i] subject-keyed review-route splits
- [d:r:i] retry / resume widening
- [d:r:i] harness-in-action parallelization rewrites
- [d:r:i] telemetry-system build-out

## Exact Next Move

1. [d:r:i] Read this revised note together with `169`.
2. [d:r:i] Run one bounded reread over the pair before implementation.
3. [d:r:i] Use the return to decide the carrier map, the pattern-library-dominant first-slice boundary, and whether the ownerless surfaces can fold into the same slice or earn a second review-route propagation follow-through note.
