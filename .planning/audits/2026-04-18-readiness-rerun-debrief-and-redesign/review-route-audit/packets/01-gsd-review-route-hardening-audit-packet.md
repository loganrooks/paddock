# GSD Review Route Hardening Audit Packet

## Lane Purpose

- [g:r:i] Audit the current repo-local `$gsd-review` route and widen the first hardening shape that would make it carry more of the repo's actual cross-vendor review discipline.

## Why This Lane Exists Now

- [e:c+i] The current overlay-owned review route still carries the older thin pattern: `/tmp` prompt/output files, sequential external invocations, and one final `REVIEWS.md` consumer artifact without durable lane-home, launch-truth, or timing calibration. Sources:

- [e:c+i] The workspace now has a richer audit-lane pattern library, launch-truth discipline, timing-calibration discipline, and provider-specific failure tooling that the current review route does not yet inherit. Sources:

- [d:r:i] The user also raised a more precise concern: a review route should vary with what the crossover is crossing into, and failure should not collapse into empty output when a last recoverable message still exists.

## Governing Questions

- [g:r:i] Should the repo harden the existing `$gsd-review` route directly, or is a separate repo-local review-route family warranted?
- [g:r:i] What is the better first-slice structure for:
  - run-home and artifact durability
  - launch-truth
  - timing estimate versus actual
  - provider-shaped runner differences
  - failure-path salvage
  - planner-facing `REVIEWS.md` carry
- [g:r:i] How should the route distinguish reviewer shapes rather than flattening them?
  - `claude` stream-json + salvage
  - `codex` jsonl/last-message + salvage
  - plain stdout/stderr reviewers
- [g:r:i] Which parts belong in a helper/tooling layer, and which should remain workflow/skill contract?

## Anti-Misread Notes

- [g:r:i] Do not widen this lane into full multi-provider portability.
- [g:r:i] Keep `.codex` and `.claude` as the primary local runtime horizon.
- [g:r:i] Do not treat `capture_launch_truth.py` as the only launch-truth model here; this lane crosses external CLI process truth too.
- [g:r:i] Do not flatten failure handling into a binary success/failure question. The lane should consider what can still be salvaged or preserved when a reviewer partially returns.
- [g:r:i] Do not propose a giant telemetry system as the first slice unless you can justify why the simpler run-home/logging layer would not carry the route far enough.

## Output Target

- [d:r:i] Write the lane return to:
  - [../outputs/01-gsd-review-route-hardening-audit-opus47-max-r1.md](../outputs/01-gsd-review-route-hardening-audit-opus47-max-r1.md)
