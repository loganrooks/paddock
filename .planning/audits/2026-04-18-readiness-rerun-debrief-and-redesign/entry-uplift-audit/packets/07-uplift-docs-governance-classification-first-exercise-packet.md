# Uplift Docs Governance Classification First Exercise Packet

## Packet Header

- Trigger: lane-05 inheritance plus the new packet/disposition carrier landed in `104/105`
- Current uplift result: `cross-runtime uplift`
- Secondary signals: `mid_phase`, `doctrine_changed`, `has_pending_proposals`
- Runtime for packet consumption: parent-thread first exercise
- Explicit write boundary: bounded classification note and disposition only
- Expected disposition home: `entry-uplift-audit/dispositions/`

## Input Packet

### Detect Summary

- [e:c+i] Current helper detect on `2026-04-22T04:11:42+00:00` reports:
  - `project_class: cross-runtime uplift`
  - `secondary_signals: mid_phase, doctrine_changed, has_pending_proposals`
  - `current_status: planning`
  - pending doctrine-sensitive proposals:
    - `AGENTS.md` -> `drifted`
    - `.planning/AGENTS.md` -> `drifted`
  - recommendation reasons:
    - doctrine reference fingerprint changed since the last uplift pass
    - doctrine-sensitive carriers still need review
