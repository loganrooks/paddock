# Where Are We Now: Horizon Inheritance And Parallelization Audit Packet

## Lane Purpose

- [g:r:i] Audit the current workspace as an operating machine:
  - what it has completed
  - how it currently inherits findings across time-scales
  - how it currently routes deferred / held / seed / doctrine carry
  - where bounded parallelization is earned
  - which governance/operator surfaces should change so the harness can carry that work more deliberately

## Why This Lane Exists Now

- [e:c+i] The repo now has many landed intervention families, multiple audit subtrees, and a richer set of state/governance surfaces, but the relationship between those surfaces, their time-scales, and their operating pattern is still more implicit than it should be. Sources:
  - [CURRENT-STATE.md](/home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/.planning/audits/2026-04-18-readiness-rerun-debrief-and-redesign/CURRENT-STATE.md:1)
  - [STATUS.md](/home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/.planning/audits/2026-04-18-readiness-rerun-debrief-and-redesign/STATUS.md:1)
  - [HARNESS-IMPROVEMENT-REGISTER.md](/home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/.planning/HARNESS-IMPROVEMENT-REGISTER.md:1)
- [d:r:i] The user also explicitly asked for a stronger answer to:
  - how the harness has been finding new surfaces relatively automatically
  - how that can intensify further
  - where parallelization is actually earned
  - what administrative/governance work should travel in parallel with long-running audits
  - whether root/planning `AGENTS.md`, lane-pattern docs, or compaction/continuation surfaces should change

## Governing Questions

- [g:r:i] How is the harness currently operating as a machine for:
  - surfacing new concerns
  - inheriting review/audit findings
  - routing them across different time-scales
  - keeping governance, propagation, and operator memory in tune
- [g:r:i] What is the current relation between:
  - short-horizon bounded next slices
  - medium-horizon family queues and held-later routes
  - long-horizon doctrine and protected seams
- [g:r:i] How are findings currently being routed among:
  - canon / doctrine
  - active state and next-slice routing
  - seeds / held-later routes
  - audit-family memory
- [g:r:i] Where is bounded parallelization actually earned now?
  - sub-agents
  - external-lane overlap with local work
  - administrative/governance/propagation work during long-running lanes
  - timing-calibrated wait windows
- [g:r:i] Which operator/governance surfaces should change if the current operating pattern is still too implicit?
  - root / planning `AGENTS.md`
  - lane-pattern docs
  - state/governance docs
  - compaction or continuation surfaces
- [g:r:i] What is the sharper relationship to longer horizons?
  - one vague orientation
  - one more concrete doctrine layer
  - differentiated horizon types that should be handled differently
  - or some other mixed relation

## Anti-Misread Notes

- [g:r:i] Do not reopen the paused Phase 01 rerun.
- [g:r:i] Do not treat the long horizon as one fully concrete roadmap that must be fixed in detail now.
- [g:r:i] Do not treat the long horizon as mere ambient aspiration either if current doctrine already carries more than that.
- [g:r:i] Do not collapse seeds, held-later notes, deferred items, and long-arc doctrine into one undifferentiated future bucket.
- [g:r:i] Do not answer only with a list of new tasks; the lane must map the current operating pattern first.
- [g:r:i] Do not assume one single perfect relation to all time-scales. If different horizon types deserve different handling, say so directly.
- [g:r:i] Keep `.codex` and `.claude` as the only meaningful runtime/provider horizon when runtime/provider matters.
- [g:r:i] Keep the answer bounded enough that later inheritance can route one or two real next moves rather than another giant abstract field.

## Output Target

- [d:r:i] Write the lane return to:
  - [../outputs/01-where-are-we-now-horizon-inheritance-and-parallelization-audit-opus47-max-r1.md](../outputs/01-where-are-we-now-horizon-inheritance-and-parallelization-audit-opus47-max-r1.md)
