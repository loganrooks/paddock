# Harness Parallelization Field Map And Diagnosis Audit Packet

## Lane Purpose

- [g:r:i] Diagnose parallelization and overlap as three different posture fields instead of one umbrella topic:
  - vanilla GSD parallelization posture
  - modified-harness parallelization posture
  - harness-improvement-program overlap posture
- [g:r:i] The lane should disclose what actually exists, what is only implied, what is only newly possible, and what still lacks enough governance or protocol clarity to be treated as an earned path.

## Why This Lane Exists Now

- [e:c+i] The workspace now has an explicit semantic and horizon split for the harness program, and `164` has already named parallelization as a distinct design field rather than a side comment under execution waves. Sources:
  - [../../intervention-proposals/162-harness-uplift-semantics-and-target-mode-split.md](../../intervention-proposals/162-harness-uplift-semantics-and-target-mode-split.md)
  - [../../intervention-proposals/163-harness-program-horizons-and-future-carry-doctrine.md](../../intervention-proposals/163-harness-program-horizons-and-future-carry-doctrine.md)
  - [../../intervention-proposals/164-harness-parallelization-opportunity-map.md](../../intervention-proposals/164-harness-parallelization-opportunity-map.md)
  - [../../intervention-proposals/165-harness-parallelization-field-mapping-and-diagnosis-route.md](../../intervention-proposals/165-harness-parallelization-field-mapping-and-diagnosis-route.md)
- [d:r:i] The map note is intentionally not a completed diagnosis. This lane exists so the workspace stops treating a few visible examples as if they were already the whole posture map.

## Governing Questions

- [g:r:i] In vanilla GSD, where is parallelization already explicit, where is it only implied, where is it absent, and where do visible serial bottlenecks seem more accidental than principled?
- [g:r:i] In the modified harness, what has actually changed in the parallelization field:
  - new opportunities opened
  - new frictions introduced
  - new protocol demands created
  - new risks to continuity or quality
- [g:r:i] In the harness-improvement program itself, what overlap patterns are already governed, what still depends too much on operator memory, and which program-side surfaces should now carry that more explicitly?
- [g:r:i] Across those three domains, what should count as:
  - safe earned parallelization
  - promising but not-yet-governed parallelization
  - parallelization that would likely degrade coherence, continuity, or software quality

## Anti-Misread Notes

- [g:r:i] Keep harness-program horizons separate from `prix-guesser` product horizons. Host-product planning docs are contextual here, not the sovereign far-horizon carrier for this lane.
- [g:r:i] Do not treat one visible wave-based execution example as if it already exhausts vanilla GSD or the modified harness.
- [g:r:i] Do not treat `Task()`/`spawn_agent` mapping blocks in skill wrappers as proof that the surrounding route already has a fully governed parallelization contract. Distinguish declared capability, suggested pattern, and live operator-surface governance.
- [g:r:i] Do not let the answer collapse into `parallelize more`.
- [g:r:i] Do not widen into multi-provider portability beyond `.codex` and `.claude`.
- [g:r:i] Do not widen into GSD Reflect, telemetry, or deployment feedback design here. Those remain adjacent responsible-closure questions, not the governing question of this lane.
- [g:r:i] Do not reopen the paused Phase 01 rerun.

## Output Target

- [d:r:i] Write the lane return to:
