# Audit-Program Infrastructure First Slice Implementation

## Purpose

- [g:r:i] This note records the first landed slice of the audit-program infrastructure family proposed in `47`.
- [d:r:i] The slice is deliberately bounded:
  - reusable audit-lane pattern library
  - canon-absorption protocol
  - audit-subtree aging and graduation protocol

## What Landed

- [d:r:i] The workspace now has a reusable audit-lane structure surface at [AUDIT-LANE-PATTERN-LIBRARY.md](../AUDIT-LANE-PATTERN-LIBRARY.md).
- [d:r:i] The workspace now has an explicit canon-absorption rule at [AUDIT-CANON-ABSORPTION-PROTOCOL.md](../AUDIT-CANON-ABSORPTION-PROTOCOL.md).
- [d:r:i] The workspace now has an explicit subtree aging/graduation rule at [AUDIT-SUBTREE-AGING-AND-GRADUATION.md](../AUDIT-SUBTREE-AGING-AND-GRADUATION.md).

## Why This Slice Matters

- [d:r:i] Repeated audit lanes in this workspace were already converging on the same structure, but that pattern lived mostly in repetition rather than in one reusable reference.
- [d:r:i] Canon uplift had real precedents, but the rule for what should move into governance, helpers, or durable register carry was still implicit.
- [d:r:i] Audit subtrees had live differences in force, but their aging path was still mostly ambient.

## What This Slice Does Not Do

- [d:r:i] It does not archive any subtree automatically.
- [d:r:i] It does not flatten all lane types into one mandatory packet/spec/prompt checklist.
- [d:r:i] It does not absorb every useful doctrine into root governance.

## Verification And Review Discipline

- [d:r:i] This slice was checked by:
  - contextual reread against the existing audit-family baselines and governance protocol
  - markdown reference verification
  - diff hygiene review
- [d:r:i] The slice is governance/document-structure work, so runtime/install canary gates were not the relevant boundary here.

## Current Consequence

- [d:r:i] Later audit families now have a named reusable structure surface instead of relying on repeated local reconstruction.
- [d:r:i] Later absorption decisions can now name their target canon layer explicitly.
- [d:r:i] Later subtree status changes can now be recorded with clearer force rather than with ambient drift.
