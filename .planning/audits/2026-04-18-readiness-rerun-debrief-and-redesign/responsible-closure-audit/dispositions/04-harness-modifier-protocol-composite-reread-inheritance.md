# Harness Modifier Protocol Composite Reread Inheritance

## Disposition

- [d:r:i] Disposition: `accept with bounded verifier-scheduling pressure preserved`
- [d:r:i] Lane `04` closes the `169 + revised 60` pair on a composite-reread basis.
- [d:r:i] A third reread is not earned.
- [d:r:i] The next move is implementation of the first protocol slice.

## What Is Carried Forward

- [d:r:i] The dominant carrier is still [../AUDIT-LANE-PATTERN-LIBRARY.md](../../AUDIT-LANE-PATTERN-LIBRARY.md), with only three narrow adjacent carriers:
  - [../../../../tooling/portable-gsd/overlay/tooling/compact-prompts/readiness.md](/home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/tooling/portable-gsd/overlay/tooling/compact-prompts/readiness.md)
  - [../../../../.planning/AGENTS.md](/home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/.planning/AGENTS.md) `Launch-Truth Discipline`
  - [../../../../.codex/get-shit-done/workflows/propagation-review.md](/home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/.codex/get-shit-done/workflows/propagation-review.md)
- [d:r:i] The first slice should land as one bounded commit batch rather than as several uncoordinated patches.
- [d:r:i] The lifecycle-verification shape stays declarative rather than widening into a state machine:
  - `Intended Effects`
  - `Propagation Obligations`
  - `Monitor Target`
  - disposition-verb close
- [d:r:i] `60` is discharged through:
  - Cluster A: edits inside the protocol slice itself
  - Cluster B: one small mechanical refresh to the governing state carriers
  - Cluster C: explicit `no edit earned` judgment for [../../review-route-audit/README.md](../../review-route-audit/README.md)

## Cluster Judgment For `60`

- [d:r:i] Cluster A `move now inside the protocol slice`:
  - [../../AUDIT-LANE-PATTERN-LIBRARY.md](../../AUDIT-LANE-PATTERN-LIBRARY.md) `Launch-truth note`
  - [../../AUDIT-LANE-PATTERN-LIBRARY.md](../../AUDIT-LANE-PATTERN-LIBRARY.md) `Timing estimate`
  - [../../../../.planning/AGENTS.md](/home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/.planning/AGENTS.md) `Launch-Truth Discipline`
  - [../../../../tooling/portable-gsd/overlay/tooling/compact-prompts/readiness.md](/home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/tooling/portable-gsd/overlay/tooling/compact-prompts/readiness.md)
  - [../../../../.codex/get-shit-done/workflows/propagation-review.md](/home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/.codex/get-shit-done/workflows/propagation-review.md)
- [d:r:i] Cluster B `mechanical change-triggered refresh only`:
  - [../../../../.planning/HARNESS-IMPROVEMENT-REGISTER.md](/home/rookslog/workspace/projects/prix-guesser/.planning/HARNESS-IMPROVEMENT-REGISTER.md)
  - [../../CURRENT-STATE.md](../../CURRENT-STATE.md)
  - [../../STATUS.md](../../STATUS.md)
- [d:r:i] Cluster C `reread clean, no edit earned`:
  - [../../review-route-audit/README.md](../../review-route-audit/README.md)

## Held Later

- [d:r:i] `167` remains sequential after this slice rather than concurrent with it.
- [d:r:i] `168` remains the explicit held-later sibling for artifact-home movement.
- [d:r:i] The following remain explicitly later rather than being smuggled into this slice:
  - single-writer / lane-exclusive authority-surface map
  - fan-out packet template
  - `Parallelization Impact` extension inside `$gsd-propagation-review`
  - root `AGENTS.md` widening
  - root `WORKFLOW.md` widening
  - harness-in-action workflow parallelization rewrites
  - subject-keyed review-route splits
  - retry / resume redesign
  - full Reflect adaptive stack

## Verifier-Scheduling Pressure Preserved

- [d:r:i] The adjacent correction in [../../intervention-proposals/170-development-parallelization-verifier-and-review-scheduling-side-note.md](../../intervention-proposals/170-development-parallelization-verifier-and-review-scheduling-side-note.md) is carried forward as explicit development-side pressure rather than discarded.
- [d:r:i] The first protocol slice may widen bounded verification/review scheduling only where it strengthens the declarative lifecycle loop without opening a heavier automation stack.
- [d:r:i] The stronger later question remains open:
  - whether development-side verifier/review scheduling should become its own reusable template or protocol surface after this first slice lands and is exercised

## Exact Next Move

1. [d:r:i] Implement the first protocol slice across the four earned carriers named above.
2. [d:r:i] Refresh Cluster B mechanically in the same bounded batch.
3. [d:r:i] Verify with `audit_refmap.py verify`, `./scripts/setup-portable-gsd.sh`, and `git diff --check`.
4. [d:r:i] Keep Phase 01 held and return to `167` only after this protocol slice is landed and dispositioned.
